# Introduction to Software Management Plans

Course materials for the SSI's Introduction to Software Management Plans workshop. Contact @npch or @steve-crouch for more info.

## Overview

A Software Management Plan (SMP) is a statement of intent around how you will manage your research software. In this workshop we will introduce SMPs, give some context about how they fulfil the joint needs of projects and funders, guide you through how to write an SMP, and how and when to use it. This workshop is suitable for PIs, project managers, and people involved in managing releases. It may also be of interest to other research software engineers and those thinking about applying for funding or starting a new project. At the end of this workshop, you will know how to write an SMP, when to revise or review it, and how to take into account the needs of funders in your SMP.
