# Breakout 1: Examining SMPs

## Comparing different examples of Software Management Plans

Spend about 15 minutes looking at these different examples of software management plans. Discuss in your group what the similarities and differences are, based on the prompt questions below. Record your discussion, we will ask groups to share some of their thoughts.

### Examples of Software Management Plans

- Optional: [the software management plan template used by the ELIXIR network](https://github.com/softwaresaved/introduction-to-software-management-plans/blob/main/examples/elixir-smp.md)

### Questions to discuss
- Which sections of an SMP are clearest to you?
- Which parts are useful for each stakeholder, and why?
- Which statements could help improve practices for the project?
- How do the different example SMPs compare?
- What level of detail seems most appropriate?
