# Breakout 2: A First SMP - and Beyond

## Part 1. Draft your first Software Management Plan - where are you now?

Spend about 15 minutes drafting an initial SMP for a project you are on (or one you are familiar with), based on the current understanding of what's happening now, using the headings below. Keep your answers short, perhaps a sentence for each section - you can always extend it later!

### Outputs
- What software will you be producing?
- Who is it for (even if it’s just for you)?
- What does it do?


### Management
- How will it be developed?
- Who’s responsible for management, quality control and releasing the software?


### Access, sharing and reuse
- How will it be made available?
- What license will it be released under?


## Part 2. Beyond the minimal SMP - what needs to change?

Spend the remainder of the breakout to ask yourself what you would like to change to the above, in terms of practices, infrastructure or use of tools - either in terms of improving something that's done already, or introducing something new.

For each aspect you include, note a suitable point by which this change should occur (e.g. an upcoming release perhaps, or another suitable deadline), and who else would need to be involved to discuss and agree on this change. Remember this is a statement of intent, so aim to keep it at a high level, at most a sentence per line. Following the workshop, you can then work what you wrote in the first part and here into your SMP using the full SMP checklist and guidance on SMPs.

List each aspect. For each:

- note a potential deadline 
- who needs to agree on the change

## Questions to discuss
- Who is typically involved in making decisions?
- When is the right point to revise an SMP?
- How do you get hold of the info to put in an SMP?
