## Example 1 – Population modelling data sharing (PhD Student)

### (i) What data outputs will your research generate and what data will have value to other researchers?

The data generated during the study with utility to other researchers will potentially include a
part/all of the following:
1. Demographic data on free-ranging dog populations (overall population size and density, age and
sex composition, body condition scores, GPS locations of sightings and boundaries of study sites etc.)
2. Number and locations of potential food sources for these populations, including GPS locations
3. Demographic and dog ownership data of people at the study sites (family size and composition,
basic socio-economic indicators, number and kind of dogs owned, nature of ownership, dog health
practices and vaccination status etc.)
4. Data on number of dogs vaccinated during mass vaccination campaigns, number of dogs captured
and vaccine doses adminstered, signs of clinical diseases (including rabies), biological samples
collected (blood/serum, saliva) etc.
5. Sero-conversion data from follow-up capture and sampling
6. Mathematical model(s), model outputs and results of statistical analyses generated
7. Other data that may be deemed necessary during the course of the study.

### (ii) When will you share the data?
Any software or programs developed during the project period will be archived online using services
such as Zenodo or Github, such that specific versions of the software are issued with Digital Object
Identifiers (DOI) at the time of deposit. These will be released for public use after completion of the
PhD. All scientific manuscripts generated from the research will be published on open-access
platforms such as Wellcome Open Research so that they are available to other researchers free of
cost, and supporting datasets will be made publicly available at the time of publishing either as
supporting information or on a separate data repository.

### (iii) Where will you make the data available?
Data will be made available either as supporting information to scientific manuscripts at the time of
publishing or on a separate data repository such as Zenodo, after being issued with a DOI.

### (iv) How will other researchers be able to access the data?
Data that can me shared unconditionally will made available when scientific manuscripts are
published or on online data repositories like Zenodo, such that they are readily accessible to other
researchers. Data that cannot be unconditionally shared upon publication owing to confidentiality or
data protection requirements will be identified as such and a contact email will be provided in
relevant publications for data access enquiries by other researchers.

### (v) Are any limits to data sharing required – for example, to either safeguard research participants or to gain appropriate intellectual property protection?
It is expected that demographic data of people at the study sites (family size and composition, basic
socio-economic indicators) may contain personally identifiable information and location data. All
such data will be anonymised prior to storage on online data repositories, and therefore will be
available to be publicly shared at the time of publication of manuscripts.

### (vi) How will you ensure that key datasets are preserved to ensure their long-term value?
Datasets will be stored in online repositories managed by the university/centre/department or
public repositories such as Zenodo, and each dataset will be issued a unique DOI. A record of all
datasets generated, with relevant metadata including the DOI, will be created using the Centre 
Datahub platform (website) of the centre and this will facilitate easy identification and retrieval of
datasets.


## Example 2 – Cardiology data and software sharing (Early Career Researcher)

### (i) What data outputs will your research generate and what data will have value to other researchers?
This project will generate the following materials
  * A software for analysis of clinical electroanatomical mapping (EAM) data
  * Associated algorithms for quantification of established and novel electrogram parameters
  * A large database of EAM data from ablation procedures
  * In silico models of cardiac tissue
  * Electrogram and optical mapping datasets from ex vivo human tissue
  * Machine learning networks designed to identify ablation targets for atrial fibrillation

The analysis tool(s) I will create will be a valuable resource for the wider research community.
Although in the outlined project I will focus my analysis methods on recurrence of atrial arrhythmias,
the software I will create will be useful in many EP research settings. To maximise impact, I will
release my software open-source. Software will be deposited in publicly accessible platforms, using
guidance as set out by the software sustainability institute (doi:10.5281/zenodo.1327310).

### (ii) When will you share the data?

Publication of the software (or updates) will occur following robust validation and proof of efficacy
as described in ‘Details of research project’. To enable researchers to use the software effectively, I
will provide example datasets and user guides, further to guidance provided in associated
publications.

### (iii) Where will you make the data available?

To maximise availability and impact, I will host the software on GitHub. This will allow for the
creation of an immediately accessible live link, which will be used for publications, presentations and
websites such as institutional and non-institutional profiles and social media. Concurrently, I will use
GitHub integration to deposit software to Zenodo. Zenodo is open-access repository where data is
stored in CERN’s research data centre. Depositing on Zenodo will provide the software with a unique
digital object identifier (doi) and safeguard current and future access. As a further step, to aid in
version control during development and pre-release, I will store software versions on the University
eData repository (UBIRA) under restricted access until release. These measures will ensure that
software created in this project will remain accessible for use and further development beyond the
timescales of this project.

### (iv) How will other researchers be able to access the data?

By releasing my software open-source, I will freely share the algorithms I develop, including machine
learning network designs. To facilitate usability of these developments, I will concurrently provide
descriptive material, beyond information that is provided in journal publications including:
  * Diagrams of overall software architecture
  * Pseudocode
  * Illustrative diagrams of key algorithmic steps

These resources will maximise impact of outputs, by explaining key developments without the
requirement for detailed understanding of their deployment (i.e. the actual code to implement
these approaches).


### (vi) How will you ensure that key datasets are preserved to ensure their long-term value?

As well as the software tools I propose, this project will utilise clinical datasets, and generate both in
silico and pre-clinical datasets for validation purposes. Datasets produced or used for validation
purposes will be made freely available in line with publication, again by online repository. I will
further submit datasets that are of sufficient interest to the research community for publication on
PhysioNet, a community resource of complex physiological signals, or data descriptor journals such
as Scientific Data.

Further to online depositing, I will share our analysis tools and additional data I generate (e.g.
predictors and mechanisms of AF recurrence post ablation) by publication and attendance of
relevant meetings. I will target meetings with a focus on the interface between basic science and
clinical cardiology, including Computing in Cardiology, British Society for Cardiovascular Research
and European Heart Rhythm Association.
