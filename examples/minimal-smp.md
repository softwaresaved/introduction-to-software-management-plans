# Software Management Plan

## Outputs
- A set of Python notebooks will be produced to analyse survey data collected as part of the project.

## Management
- The notebooks will be developed in a public code repository on GitHub.
- All team members will be responsible for checking that the code runs before committing to the repository; that files, functions and variables are appropriately named; and dependencies are recorded.
- The PI is responsible for designating the formal release that accompanies a paper submission.

## Access, sharing and reuse
- The code will be freely available under a BSD license from GitHub from the start of the project and formal releases deposited in Zenodo for preservation purposes
