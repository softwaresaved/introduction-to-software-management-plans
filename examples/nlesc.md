## 1.	What	measures	will	be	taken	during	the	project	to	ensure	the	long-term	sustainability	of	the	software developed	in	the	project?	(max	300	words)

Some	examples	include:
* A	researcher	or	RSE	from	a	research	institute	is	allocated	to	the	project	to	co-develop	the	software	during	the	project	
and	help	maintain	it	afterwards.
* A	community	will	co-develop	the	software	and	help	maintain	it	afterwards.
* Organizing	workshops	and	hands-on	user	training	to	create	or	extend	a	community	around	the	software.
* The	software	will	be	developed	as	part	of	an	overarching	software	suite	used	in	other	(research)	projects.
* A	commercial	partner	interested	in	exploiting	the	software	is	included	as	co-applicant	on	the	basis	of	a	concrete	incash	or	in-kind	investment.	

## 2.	What	measures	will	be	taken	to	support	the	software	after	the	duration	of	the	project?	(max	300	words)

Some	examples	include:
* The	software	is	hosted	by	an	institute	and	a	user	support	desk	is	made	available	for	a	certain	period.
* The	software	is	integrated	into	teaching	in	a	course	on	the	Bachelor	or	Master	level
* The	software	is	integrated	into	a	research	infrastructure	based	on	a	large	community.
* A	commercial	partner	or	spin-off	will	continue	the	support	and	development	of the	software.

## 3.	What	resources	are	needed	to	ensure	the	long-term	usability	and	availability	of	the	software,	and	how	will	
these	resources	be	funded	or	obtained?	(max	300	words)

Some	examples	include:
* Storage	or	compute	infrastructure	needed	to	host	the	software.
* RSEs	needed	to	maintain	the	software	and	support	the	community	that	uses	it.
* A	user	support	desk.

## 4.	Are	there	other	measures	that	will	be	taken	to	promote	the	softwareâ€™s	longevity?	(max	300	words)

Some	examples	include:
* Additional	project	proposals	which	will	help	to	further	develop	the	software.
* Outreach	though	mainstream	media	such	as	newspaper	articles,	blogs.	YouTube	videos,	tweets,	etc
